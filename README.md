# 👋 Hello there! 🙏 I'm Alex.  Thank you for checking out my profile.

- 📣 Some things about me: one mantra that I always keep in mind is "Let's get things done!", while one of my passions is investigative work and finding solutions to issues while maintaining a critical thinking approach and being deliberately proactive. 

- 📣 Being an autodidact, I am a self-starter with a builder's personality and what drives my curiosity is the thirst to learn, develop, find out how to do things and how they work, how to make them work more efficiently & qualitatively better and I have no issues adapting and coping with new right away. 

- 📣 I am also good at execution, a performing team member, with a strategical approach and technical/functional skills. For more details check my entire profile.

- ↗️ I’m currently learning and improving my Python 🐍 knowledge.

- ❗ I am open to opportunities to which my profile is a fit: Python developer, business intelligence analyst, data analyst or strategy analyst.

- 💬 Feel free to reach out by sending a connection request and a dm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexonati/) and don't forget to checkout my [portofolio (built using Flask)](https://tzunu.pythonanywhere.com/).
